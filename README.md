# SPDY Server for node.js

With this module you can create [SPDY](http://www.chromium.org/spdy) servers
in node.js with natural http module interface and fallback to regular https
(for browsers that doesn't support SPDY yet).

It's using SSL's NPN feature that is available in node from 0.6.0 version, but
requires you to build node with latest openssl.

## Node+OpenSSL building

At the moment node-spdy requires zlib dictionary support which will come to
node.js only in 0.7.x version.

```bash
# Download and build zlib (you'll need to install it globally)
wget http://www.zlib.net/zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz
tar -xzvf zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz
cd zlib-1.2.5
./configure
sudo make install

# Download and build openssl
wget ftp://ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/openssl-1.0.1-stable-SNAP-20111206.tar.gz
tar -xzvf openssl-1.0.1-stable-SNAP-20111206
cd openssl-1.0.1-stable-SNAP-20111206
./config shared zlib --prefix=~/.local/openssl # add -fPIC if you're on x86-64
make depend
make
make install

# Allow dynamic linking to custom version of openssl
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.local/openssl/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> .bashrc

# Download and build node
wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.7.0/node-v0.7.0.tar.gz
tar -xzvf node-v0.7.0.tar.gz
cd node-v0.7.0
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.local/node/npn \
    --openssl-includes=$HOME/.local/openssl/include \
    --openssl-libpath=$HOME/.local/openssl/lib
make -j4 # If you have 4 CPU cores
make install

# Add node's bin to PATH
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.local/node/npn/bin:$PATH' >> .bashrc
```

## Usage

```javascript
var spdy = require('spdy');

var options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/../keys/spdy-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/../keys/spdy-cert.pem'),
  ca: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/../keys/spdy-csr.pem')
};

spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('hello world!');
});

spdy.listen(443);
```
